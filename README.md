# Parallax Effect Web Page
This project demonstrates the parallax effect using HTML and CSS. Parallax scrolling creates an illusion of depth by moving different layers at different speeds as the user scrolls down the page. In this example, it's used to create a dynamic and immersive storytelling experience.

## Technologies Used
**HTML5**: Used for structuring the web page content.

**CSS3**: Utilized for styling and creating the parallax effect.

**Images**: Background and foreground images to create the parallax layers.

## How to Use

Clone the repository and open the index.html file in your web browser to view the parallax effect in action. The scrolling will reveal different layers of images and text, creating a visually appealing experience.

## Features
**Parallax Effect**: Background and foreground images move at different speeds as the user scrolls, creating a 3D effect.
